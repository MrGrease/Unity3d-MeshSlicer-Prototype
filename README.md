The prototype imitates the slicing action of cutting the sand with the use of [The ezy-slice library](https://github.com/DavidArayan/ezy-slice)
Other free asset store items have also been used to add visual charm and save time.
The app "ASMR Slicing" also deforms the sliced sand to exagerate the effect of slicing, however this is not present in this prototype as the usage mesh deformation
is well beyond the scope of this project.
